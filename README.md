# UNI2-Music-Mods
This is a series of mods for UNDER NIGHT IN-BIRTH II Sys:Celes that replaces/adds music to the game.

## Installation
1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Yuberz/UNI2-Music-Mods/releases) for the mod that you want.
2. If you have any conflicting mods (makes changes to music) then uninstall them or you will have to manually edit the text file to merge them.
3. Extract all the files to the root of the UNI2 folder (__English folder should be next to uni2.exe).

## Notes
It's actually really easy to make music mods for UNI2, everything you need to know is in [this guide](https://github.com/Fatih120/undernightinbirth/blob/master/AUDIO.md)!

This link is also helpful for learning how to merge music mods, since there's no way to do that right now.
